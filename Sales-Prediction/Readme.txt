# Task 4 â€“ Sales Prediction using Python

This project is part of my **CodeAlpha Internship**.

We predict future sales based on advertising spend across different media platforms (TV, Radio, Newspaper).  
The goal is to forecast sales and analyze how changes in advertising budgets impact outcomes.

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview
- Predict **Sales** from advertising spend features:
  - TV advertising spend
  - Radio advertising spend
  - Newspaper advertising spend
- Prepare data: cleaning, transformation, and feature selection.
- Use a **regression model** (Linear Regression) to forecast sales.
- Evaluate model performance using metrics like RÂ² Score and RMSE.
- Analyze the impact of each advertising channel on sales.
